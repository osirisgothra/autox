subj:	Renaming Aliases Directly

If you want to rename aliases stored here you will need to rename both the file's name and the
name contained inside the file. You could just rename the name inside the file but that would
later confuse you (and others) so it is best to do both. Even better is to use the pre-written
integrated utilities (alias, unalias, gunalias, galias) to do this. Specifically, gmvalias or
mvalias is used to rename an alias definition.

At the time of this writing, mvalias and gmvalias were not yet written, so, if you cannot find
those commands, it means you need to download a newer version/commit of autox that does.
