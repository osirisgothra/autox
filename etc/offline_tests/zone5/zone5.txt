corrupted, errored, or otherwise screwed up or truncated files

Reasoning
=========

* after CRISIS we needed a place for these
* this one prompted the making of the tarchive
* shortly later we found that the trun were almost all intended to be
  deleted, after reviewing the commit logs in detail!

* zero-length files take up no space :) (but filenames take a *little*)
