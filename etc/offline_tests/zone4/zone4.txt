executable tests, put in your path (i use /etc/environment on my system)


Reasoning
=========

* also, using .bashrc, adding it to that path as well

* when I say path, i mean "PATH=$PATH:<ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_zone4_DIR>" gets executed somewhere!!

* on my system, i use /etc/environment, which is just lazy -- if you use it use ~/.bashrc

The following extras
====================

For the sake of R&D, i also extended this behavior for pure testing purposes, cause and
effect, etc etc.. it's setup is very different depending on where you are
executing your shell from:

zone4/first is situated as the VERY FIRST path in the 'PATH' variable
zone4/last is situated as the VERY LAST path in the 'PATH' variable
zone4/ is situated AFTER the non-local paths, but BEFORE the local paths (/usr/local/*)


NOTE: it is not a good idea to make this system-wide (like I did) because it WILL cause problems
      the only reason I do it is because this entire machine is a development server that only
      is used for that purpose, complete with fake user accounts, software that I don't actually use,
      ssh accounts, local mail, a bunch of standard computer stuff that is for a multiuser environment
      even though I don't actually use it in that way or have other users on it for real.

      reminder: zone testing is not meant for any real application, anything useful here MUST be first
                into the actual autox non-zone directories, read the README.md in offline_tests for more
                info on that (or the main README.md)
