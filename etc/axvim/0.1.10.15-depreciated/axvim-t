" remember not to set anything fancy here --- especially things that require escape sequences or control codes
" do not assume: tab size, backspace/delete key works, insert/over selection works, shift/caps methods
" never assume: arrow keys and anything else that is not part of the 'main key pool' on your keyboard (like fkeys, ins/home/pgup, etc)
" no, using the Ctrl-K codes wont work here: (using <C-w> instead of ^W will not make it all beter, just dont use em)

" FYI: Nobody "WANTS" this setup, it is just what happens when all the other ones, even the 'console' settings fail or communication
"      with the device itself is blocked (like when in telnet or rlogin) -- that said, avoid such sessions unless emergency ensues!
"      These settings should work no matter if it is a dumb terminal or a 'xterm-256color-unicode-advanced' or whatever, even if
"      you have TERM='some-obscure-terminal' it should STILL work as a dumb terminal. From here, find out why you got this detection
"      in the main loader file.
