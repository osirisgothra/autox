If you are a user, you are probably looking for:

	1) The autox webpage: http://osirisgothra.github.io/autox
	2) The autox release repository: http://github.com/osirisgothra/autox
	
	
	``ALSO``
	
	- If you contribute make sure you are requesting to dev, not master
	- Make sure pull requests are filled out all the way 
	- Issues require an issue code (if that ever gets used) if some non-admin posts an issue
	- Be sure to use the 'master' branch for stable copies!
	- Developments on this branch only pertain to the website itself.
	
	
The autox website pages/images are licensed under GNU GPL 3. Other files (scripts for example) are
