WHATSNEW

... a log of what new features were added and when, subversions divided into
    date segments MMDDYY (so we are at version 0.0.093015 at the time of the
    first writing).

ALMOST!    
0.0.210216 - updated for 2016 roll over new year stuff, copyright updated to
             automatically show the current year (no more updating cpyrds!!)
             
             more ax. namespace orginization
             bugfixes, too many to list
             some features changed, etc, as in the planned lists below
             this one goes live to git/dev on autox

0.0.123115 - fast-forward catchuping

0.0.102115
    - This is the last bit of additions before the FIRST RELEASE, happening
      in NOVEMBER OR DECEMBER!!
    - Speed up on autox by rewriting much of the core autox script, removing
      phase features that didnt seem to make too much difference during R/D
    - Fixed some minor issues in autox
    - Added 'metadata' that can be attached to ANY autox object file
    - Introduced object-side support for metadata in aliases and 'funcs'
    - Added lyrics parser, ax.media.getlyrics, which is an alias pointing
      to one of the ax.media.getlyrics.?? items. There are also (at this time 1
      ) bindings to them for program support. Since the simplest is mocp, I have
      included bindings on it for both azlyrics.com and musixmatch.com. Currently
      it seems that musixmatch is the better choice and supports better realiabilty
      and consistency. azlyrics requires you to have 'html2text' installed, not
      installed by default on many unix systems!
    - The mocp bindings for getlyrics will grab lyrics from the currently playing
      item and dump it to terminal. 
    - AX_BASE is the base dir variable for autox. Now we have AX_USERBASE too, which
      points to ~/.config/autox, which identically stores USER-SPECIFIC stuff. Much
      of the tools are yet to support it, but funcs and aliases SHOULD work they
      will be in ~/.config/autox/alias|func. Note that since they are personal
      it will be YOU adding these. More to come, see planned in the future below.
    - You can now run autox if you want, without embedding it in any file, just be
      sure to source it
    - Fixed the CTRL+N feature so it works without freezing up
    - Fixed the startup so it only runs one time instead of two
    - Added GUIDs to _ALL_ directories -- these MUST NOT change, they identify each dir without
      needing names, which is going to be used by client-side obfuscation later on to boost security!  
      
      Planned in the future 
      - a parser that will put lyrics to text files with the same name of the currently playing item so Ctrl+L
        in mocp will show it, it would be run by mocp each time a new song is played
      - a list feature that grabs help and info from the metadata
      - actually adding to default aliases and funcs distributed with the program
      - finish user-config support
    
      - continue work on obfuscation of user settings to avoid any third party peeking
              

Hum...
