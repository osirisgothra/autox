Autox is in it's extreme early phases of development. Much like it's sister, gxbase, it is
a personal project. I actually am half serious with autox more than gxbase but at this time
I do not recommend using it in everyday life. If you must try it, you will need to do one
thing after cloning this repo:

	ln -s /[ax_clone_location]/autox ~/.bash_completion
	

Of course, if you have that file, just rename it to:

	mv ~/.bash_completion ~/.bash_completion.ax
	
To ensure it is run at the proper time!


That's it, it should just work, however lots of the presets are me-specific so you may
want to remove everything from the presets in: (ax is the [ax_clone_loc])

	/ax/func
	/ax/alias

As for the vim configuration thing (/ax/etc/axvim) that is another side project that
goes with developing this monster, to use that just link /ax/etc/axvim/axvim to
replace the original '~/.vimrc' and make sure you rename your .vimrc to .vimrc.ax
so it gets ran too (it could conflict however).
