# PURPOSE:  items that are allowed to exist as a func and, ana alias
#           there is usually also an external command in the path. These are done this way
#           on purpose in order to create seamless use cases for each individual command
# (ie, sudo runs alias sudo from user, but \sudo via an alias so user
#  is warned its not needed since the alias ran sudo anyway, and, the command is hidden but called by the func, which was called by the alias
#  so that when running as root, the entire process can be short-circuted to a single command (the original)
#
#  USER: sudo apt-get install (gets warning about sudo)
# ALIAS: \sudo apt-get install (bypassed, called as func)
#  FUNC: /bin/sudo apt-get install (binary is executed  directly by func, making sure not to short-circut to itself's alias)
