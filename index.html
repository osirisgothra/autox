        <h3>
<a id="welcome-to-autox" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-autox" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to AutoX</h3>

<p>AutoX is intended to be a hands free bash shell. In it's current state, the features can be boiled down to:
1) alias and func persistence
2) separation of global and local aliases
3) bootstraps (startup plug-ins for extending the environment)
4) "live" functions (functions whose changes are available as soon as save it's source file)
5) slightly enhanced completions - combines the features of _minimal and _longopt giving any genral commands completion suggestions when --help is available.
6) macro library usable by all scripts within the environment, or, loadable/copyable to completely different environments
7) many pre-written presets, loaders, aliases, etc (hereafter known as 'presets'), after all I, the project developer, use it every day!
8) licensed under the GNU GPL 3, except the presets and macros, which are public domain :)
9) easy to install, just link the main 'autox' script to '~/.bash_completion' and you are done (relatively unintrusive!)

Many of these features are already in place either partially or fully. This is an ongoing sort of thing. I have, just today for example, separated the project
into a 'master' and 'dev' branch so there will always be 'knock on wood' a working version. I will keep my latest work posted to 'dev' network permitting.

<a id="autox-is-automatic-for-the-shell-people" class="anchor" href="#autox-is-automatic-for-the-shell-people" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AutoX is Automatic for the (Shell) People</h3>

<p>Okay, so there is this other project of mine, very simmilar, called GXBASE, which went through many stages
of R&D testing with real people. The project does still exist but it is esoteric because the coupling of the features
as wound pretty tightly around /etc/bash* and its /etc/bash.completion. The end result is that nobody wanted it to
have a complicated setup, or be intrusive. Also, it was to be just as easily uninstalled without any side effects.

Now, we have autox which was born from (and continues to borrow from) source of gxbase, which is also made available here for at GitHub.
This project, like it's sister is a personal project that I do on my own without any other team helping me (except for real-world
people that give me feedback on it's use). But, unlike GXBASE, it is not esoteric nor is it polymorphic in purpose. Now that
that purpose has gained solid footing, I pulled what was needed into the newly created AutoX branch.

The source repository could be cleaner, and there are several IDE's that I have used on and off:
- KomodoEdit is used for all the Perl code
- PyCharm CE for the Python stuff
- QtCreator/Designer,etc for any binaries that are either in C or C++ (usually C++)
- Sublime Text 3 is used for the days when I must edit more than 3 languages at a time because running 3 IDEs hogs too much memory
- Nano >=2.4.2 + my zone4 nanopatch if I am in a BIG hurry (it uses a customized set of patches to allow some extended settings and colors to be used (see my nanopatch in /etc/offline-testing/zone4)
- VIM >= 7.4 self-compiled (i make some esoteric changes to VIM that I would not think useful to anyone else) for whenever I am on a non-graphical terminal for ALL these above (the complete setup I use is included in the /etc/axvim section)

<a id="automatic-installation" class="anchor" href="#automatic-installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Automatic Installation</h3>

<p>Auto install is planned, but not yet available. I feel at this time the link to bash_completion is good enough. Now
if you actually already use that file, just rename it to .bash_completion.ax and the loader will pick it up (first) for you.
This pickup will be done exactly ONE TIME as bash does as well.

  If you do not use bash completion at all for some reason, you can just add the line:
  
  'source ~/.bash_completion'
  
  To your ~/.bashrc script (or create an empty '~/.bashrc' first if you dont already have one). </p>
